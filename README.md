# PCAWG-to-MutSigCV

This project is for processing PCAWG somatic mutation and coverage files. The processed files are used as input for MutSigCV to identify significantly mutated gene in cancer.

Inputs requires:
1. Coverage: Retrieve .wig file for processing coverage files at [PCAWG portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/wig_files)
2. Mutation: Retrieve PCAWG SNV MAF files(The ICGA part could be retrieved at [PCAWG portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/), the TCGA part is controlled access so make sure you have the access, then go to GDC website to retrieve the data)
3. Reference files upon requests
