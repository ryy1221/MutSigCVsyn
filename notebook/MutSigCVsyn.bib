abstract = {The use of current high-throughput genetic, genomic and post-genomic data leads to the simultaneous evaluation of a large number of statistical hypothesis and, at the same time, to the multiple-testing problem. As an alternative to the too conservative Family-Wise Error-Rate (FWER), the False Discovery Rate (FDR) has appeared for the last ten years as more appropriate to handle this problem. However one drawback of FDR is related to a given rejection region for the considered statistics, attributing the same value to those that are close to the boundary and those that are not. As a result, the local FDR has been recently proposed to quantify the specific probability for a given null hypothesis to be true.},

abstract = {The discovery of driver mutations is one of the key motivations for cancer genome sequencing. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types, we describe DriverPower, a software package that uses mutational burden and functional impact evidence to identify driver mutations in coding and non-coding sites within cancer whole genomes. Using a total of 1373 genomic features derived from public sources, DriverPower's background mutation model explains up to 93% of the regional variance in the mutation rate across multiple tumour types. By incorporating functional impact scores, we are able to further increase the accuracy of driver discovery. Testing across a collection of 2583 cancer genomes from the PCAWG project, DriverPower identifies 217 coding and 95 non-coding driver candidates. Comparing to six published methods used by the PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Working Group, DriverPower has the highest F1 score for both coding and non-coding driver discovery. This demonstrates that DriverPower is an effective framework for computational driver discovery.},

abstract = {A comprehensive catalog of cancer driver mutations is essential for understanding tumorigenesis and developing therapies. Exome-sequencing studies have mapped many protein-coding drivers, yet few non-coding drivers are known because genome-wide discovery is challenging. We developed a driver discovery method, ActiveDriverWGS, and analyzed 120,788 cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 1,844 whole tumor genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. We found 30 CRMs with enriched SNVs and indels (FDR < 0.05). These frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) were ubiquitously active in human tissues, showed long-range chromatin interactions and mRNA abundance associations with target genes, and were enriched in motif-rewiring mutations and structural variants. Genomic deletion of one FMRE in human cells caused proliferative deficiencies and transcriptional deregulation of cancer genes CCNB1IP1, CDH1, and CDKN2B, validating observations in FMRE-mutated tumors. Pathway analysis revealed further sub-significant FMREs at cancer genes and processes, indicating an unexplored landscape of infrequent driver mutations in the non-coding genome.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes, each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature1. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium2 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses3–15, enabled the discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated—but distinct—DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human cancer.},

@article{Parks2018,
abstract = {Background: Procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) are widely applied as a solution to the multiple comparisons problem of high-dimensional statistics. Current FDR-controlling procedures require accurately calculated p-values and rely on extrapolation into the unknown and unobserved tails of the null distribution. Both of these intermediate steps are challenging and can compromise the reliability of the results. Results: We present a general method for controlling the FDR that capitalizes on the large amount of control data often found in big data studies to avoid these frequently problematic intermediate steps. The method utilizes control data to empirically construct the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and directly compares this distribution to the empirical distribution of the test data. By not relying on p-values, our control data-based empirical FDR procedure more closely follows the foundational principles of the scientific method: that inference is drawn by comparing test data to control data. The method is demonstrated through application to a problem in structural genomics. Conclusions: The method described here provides a general statistical framework for controlling the FDR that is specifically tailored for the big data setting. By relying on empirically constructed distributions and control data, it forgoes potentially problematic modeling steps and extrapolation into the unknown tails of the null distribution. This procedure is broadly applicable insofar as controlled experiments or internal negative controls are available, as is increasingly common in the big data setting.},

abstract = {Loss of epithelial polarity and gain in invasiveness by carcinoma cells are critical events in the aggressive progression of cancers and depend on phenotypic transition programs such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many studies have reported the aberrant expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) in carcinomas and specifically the NaV1.5 isoform, encoded by the SCN5A gene, in breast cancer. NaV1.5 activity, through an entry of sodium ions, in breast cancer cells is associated with increased invasiveness, but its participation to the EMT has to be clarified. In this study, we show that reducing the expression of NaV1.5 in highly aggressive human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reverted the mesenchymal phenotype, reduced cancer cell invasiveness and the expression of the EMT-promoting transcription factor SNAI1. The heterologous expression of NaV1.5 in weakly invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells induced their expression of both SNAI1 and ZEB1 and increased their invasive capacities. In MCF-7 cells the stimulation with the EMT-activator signal TGF-$\beta$1 increased the expression of SCN5A. Moreover, the reduction of the salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) expression promoted NaV1.5-dependent invasiveness and expression of EMT-associated transcription factor SNAI1. Altogether, these results indicated a prominent role of SIK1 in regulating NaV1.5-dependent EMT and invasiveness.},

abstract = {In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrentlymutatedmore than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling themutation counts of the elements with a $\beta$-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 wholegenome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org).},

abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a vast unexplored genetic space that may hold missing drivers of tumourigenesis, but few such "driver lncRNAs" are known. Until now, they have been discovered through changes in expression, leading to problems in distinguishing between causative roles and passenger effects. We here present a different approach for driver lncRNA discovery using mutational patterns in tumour DNA. Our pipeline, ExInAtor, identifies genes with excess load of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across panels of tumour genomes. Heterogeneity in mutational signatures between cancer types and individuals is accounted for using a simple local trinucleotide background model, which yields high precision and low computational demands. We use ExInAtor to predict drivers from the GENCODE annotation across 1112 entire genomes from 23 cancer types. Using a stratified approach, we identify 15 high-confidence candidates: 9 novel and 6 known cancer-related genes, including MALAT1, NEAT1 and SAMMSON. Both known and novel driver lncRNAs are distinguished by elevated gene length, evolutionary conservation and expression. We have presented a first catalogue of mutated lncRNA genes driving cancer, which will grow and improve with the application of ExInAtor to future tumour genome projects.},

abstract = {Loss of epithelial polarity and gain in invasiveness by carcinoma cells are critical events in the aggressive progression of cancers and depend on phenotypic transition programs such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many studies have reported the aberrant expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) in carcinomas and specifically the NaV1.5 isoform, encoded by the SCN5A gene, in breast cancer. NaV1.5 activity, through an entry of sodium ions, in breast cancer cells is associated with increased invasiveness, but its participation to the EMT has to be clarified. In this study, we show that reducing the expression of NaV1.5 in highly aggressive human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reverted the mesenchymal phenotype, reduced cancer cell invasiveness and the expression of the EMT-promoting transcription factor SNAI1. The heterologous expression of NaV1.5 in weakly invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells induced their expression of both SNAI1 and ZEB1 and increased their invasive capacities. In MCF-7 cells the stimulation with the EMT-activator signal TGF-$\beta$1 increased the expression of SCN5A. Moreover, the reduction of the salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) expression promoted NaV1.5-dependent invasiveness and expression of EMT-associated transcription factor SNAI1. Altogether, these results indicated a prominent role of SIK1 in regulating NaV1.5-dependent EMT and invasiveness.},
